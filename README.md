				<p>
					In CityU, everybody (almost) has a schedule, 
					listing when and where our classes are going to be.<br>
					Normally, a <strong>screenshot</strong> of "Weekly Schedule" is taken and stored in our phones or even set as wallpaper, 
					<strong>However</strong>, troubles come:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Why the ugly timetable should occupy my desktop!"
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"Why the schedule doesn't tell me whether <strong>this week</strong> I need to take this course or not!"
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"Come on!!! I need someone to remind me before the class!!!"
				</blockquote>
				<p class="lead">
					So here is <strong>TimeSheettyU<small>beta</small></strong>, making schedule into your Calendar App, remind setting, weekly detecting, extendable, and simplifying your timetable!
