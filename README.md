			<label>A web tool generating calendar files which can be read by most calandar apps among the world from your CityU schedule <strong>AUTOMATICCALLY</strong>.</label>
			<div class="well well-sm">
				<p>
					In CityU, everybody (almost) has a schedule, 
					listing when and where our classes are going to be.<br>
					Normally, a <strong>screenshot</strong> of "Weekly Schedule" is taken and stored in our phones or even set as wallpaper, 
					<strong>However</strong>, troubles come:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Why the ugly timetable should occupy my desktop!"
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"Why the schedule doesn't tell me whether <strong>this week</strong> I need to take this course or not!"
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"Come on!!! I need someone to remind me before the class!!!"
				</blockquote>
				<p class="lead">
					So here is <strong>TimeSheettyU<small>beta</small></strong>, making schedule into your Calendar App, remind setting, weekly detecting, extendable, and simplifying your timetable!

			<h1>FUTURE PLAN</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Let users can merge two or even more schedules into one. (for groups or lovers).</li>
				<li>Let users choose whether their calendars are private or public, when public, anyone could see and merge them, if private, only someone owning the key can see and merge them.</li>
				<li>Add real-time function to display who is having classes now (only display public calendars).</li>
