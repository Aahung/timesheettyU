#TimeSheettyU

A web app that automatically extract schedule from your CityU AIMS into your calendar Apps

In CityU, everybody (almost) has a schedule, most students save their calendars by:

- making screenshots and save the screenshots into their phones or set as wallpaper 
	- *small, ugly, always out of style.* 
- Inputing course details into the calendar apps in their phones one by one 
	- **What an annoying JOB!**


Now, you will never need to do it.

##How To Use

1. Open the "My Detail Schedule" in AIMS and see the source code;

2. Copy the source code into the text box in [TimeSheetyU page](https://xinhong.me/idea/ics/);

3. Use your phone to scan the QR Code and download the calendar file;

4. ENJOY!

##Note

It's recommended to use a new calendar to store the schedule (making the choice while opening the schedule file). In case your schedule is changed you can simply remove the whole calendar then create a new one.

##Future Plan

- Allow users to merge two or even more schedules into one (for groups or lovers).

- Allow users to choose whether their calendars are private or public. Anyone could see and merge public calendars, but only someone owning the key can see and merge private ones.

- Implement a function to display who is having classes now at real time (only display public calendars).
