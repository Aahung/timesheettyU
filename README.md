			<h1>FUTURE PLAN</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Let users can merge two or even more schedules into one. (for groups or lovers).</li>
				<li>Let users choose whether their calendars are private or public, when public, anyone could see and merge them, if private, only someone owning the key can see and merge them.</li>
				<li>Add real-time function to display who is having classes now (only display public calendars).</li>
